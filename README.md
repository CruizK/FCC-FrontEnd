# FCC-ResponsiveDesign
This is a culmnication of my implementation of [FreeCodeCamps](https://www.freecodecamp.org) Responsive Design projects.


## FCC-Tribute 
This is the first, and simplest project, I chose to do a simple one, without much content about Magnus Carlsen,
who is hailed as one of the best chess players to ever play the game.


## FCC-Survey
This is the second project. This one gave me a lot of trouble because of my inexperience with how block and inline-block as well as differing html tags with styling interconnected with eachother. As well as attempting to get labels to properly work and position correctly without using flexbox or grid. I ended up mostly copying the given sample in order to get a better grasp. I should go back one day and actually implement my own version.

## FCC-Landing
This one took a lot of headache as I didn't allow myself to look at the example projects code anymore, as it led to me mostly copying it in the last project. I feel much more comfortable at positioning elements, mostly thanks to flexbox being much easier to use and make responsive than the previous methods. The webpage still looks like a dull gray page from 2002, but at least it shrinkes with the window! Next project i'm gonna force myself to use a color scheme of some kind. As someone who much prefers developing, i still hate css with a passion because it feels like it follows no stream of logic and feels like i'm learning a whole new programming language that an alien created in 200 b.c.
