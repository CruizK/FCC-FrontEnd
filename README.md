# FCC-FrontEnd
This is a culmnication of my implementation of [FreeCodeCamps](https://www.freecodecamp.org) front end projects.


## FCC-Tribute - Done
This is the first, and simplest project, I chose to do a simple one, without much content about Magnus Carlsen,
who is hailed as one of the best chess players to ever play the game.


## FCC-Survey - Semi-Done
This is the second project. This one gave me a lot of trouble because of my inexperience with how block and inline-block as well as differing html tags with styling interconnected with eachother. As well as attempting to get labels to properly work and position correctly without using flexbox or grid. I ended up mostly copying the given sample in order to get a better grasp. I should go back one day and actually implement my own version.
